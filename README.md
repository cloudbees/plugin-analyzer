# plugin-analyzer
Java library for analysing plugin list and provide information depending on envelope membership or not

# ToDo
* add to the report file information from the envelope coming from the last available product release
* provide feedback to CloudBees internal on the envelope content consistency about plugins, their dependencies and their type, their scope (see what Adrien developed on https://github.com/cloudbees/plugin-dependency-analyzer)
